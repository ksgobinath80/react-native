MediaWiki Search page development in React Native.

The search box should be powered by: MediaWiki https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page
• Run a search, whatever content comes back from the search, please load that information inside the app
• If you click on a link inside the content, it should make another call and replace the current content with the new content
